let a = b = 2;

console.log(a--);  //Output: 2 because the decrement is a post operation
console.log(++c); //Output: -1 because the increment is a pre operation
console.log(a);   // Output: 1 because the decrement is operated here
console.log(c);   //Output: -1 because the operation is already performed & requires another round
