YES, Function are values in JavaScript. They can be assigned, copied, or declared in any place of the
code. 
function func(n1, n2){    //This is example of function declaration
    return n1 + n2;
}

let func = function(n1, n2){   //This is an example of assignment of function to a variable.
    return n1 + n2;
};

let func = (n1, n2)=>n1 + n2;   //this is an arrow function

CallBack function is a kind of function where we use one function as an argument in another.
