I don't think that there should always be a comment to functions;
Comments are our messages to other developers (and ourselves, 
if we come back to our code after several months working on something else). 

Comments donâ€™t hurt anybody if we do them right. 
If our comments end up in the code that end users see then something is not going right.

 Comment when there is an important thing to say, and if you do comment use the /* */ notation. 
 Single line comments using // can be problematic if people minify your code without 
 stripping comments and in general are less versatile.
