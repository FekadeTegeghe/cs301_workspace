What is the use of HTML id and class attributes?
Answer:
HTML id and class attributes identify an element in an HTML document. 
This is useful for applying styles and manipulating an element with 
DOM and JavaScript.

Would it be better to use a class, id or element when?
• You want to style one paragraph representing your company's mission statement
• Several list items are important, they should appear in red
• All h2 headings in the page should be underlined

The class selector uses the HTML class attribute, and is defined with a "." 
A simple way to look at it is that an id is unique to only one element.
 class is better to use as it will help you to execute what ever you want.
