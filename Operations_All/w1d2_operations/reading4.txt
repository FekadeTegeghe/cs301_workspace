The use of !! is to change the value of an expression from its current state to its opposite and back to its current state.
example: let x = 5 
         !x = -5 
         !!x = 5
Nullish coalescing(??) operator treats null and undefined similarly.
An expression is assumed defined when it is neither null nor undefined  in this case.
Thus, ?? returns the first argument if it is neither null nor undefined as in the following expressions.
The result of a??b is:
=> a if a is defined otherwise b. 
Example: let userName = "Sosina";
         alert(userName ?? "anonymous"); //Output: Sosina 
         alert("anonymous" ?? userName); //Output: Sosina
         alert("anonymous" ?? undefined); //Output: undefined
let programmingLanguageName = null;
let IDE = null;
let LanguageNickName = "js";

// shows the first defined value:
alert(programmingLanguageName ?? IDE ?? languageNickName ?? "Anonymous"); // js
